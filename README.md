# SpringAI
What is Spring AI?
Spring AI is a part of the Spring ecosystem that makes it easier to work with AI services like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, 
Hugging Face, and others using familiar Spring patterns. It abstracts away the complexity of working directly with APIs and provides 
clean interfaces for integrating AI into Java/Spring applications.

# Key Features:

Easy integration with AI models (LLMs, image generation, embeddings, etc.)
Spring-style configuration and dependency injection
Prompt templating
Support for chat-based models (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
